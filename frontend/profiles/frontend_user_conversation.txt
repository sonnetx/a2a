2025-08-23T09:22:10.894472|user|i'm sonnet, I work on generative AI research at Stanford and develop LLM tooling for diverse applications in research, venture, and industry. My experience spans generative AI, civil and technical AI ethics, as well as environmental robotics and medical research. Excited to tackle complex challenges where technology meets society.
2025-08-23T09:22:10.895492|assistant|Nice to meet you, Sonnet! Your work sounds fascinating and incredibly relevant to the current AI landscape. The intersection of generative AI research with practical applications across research, venture, and industry is such a dynamic space right now.

I'm particularly interested in your background spanning both the technical and ethical dimensions of AI - that combination seems crucial as these technologies become more powerful and widespread. The civil and technical AI ethics work must give you valuable perspective on responsible development practices.

Your diverse experience across environmental robotics and medical research also suggests you've seen AI applications in some really impactful domains. 

What aspects of generative AI research are you most excited about currently? And are there particular challenges at the technology-society intersection that you're finding especially compelling to work on?
2025-08-23T09:22:32.762511|user|can you just connect me with poeple?
2025-08-23T09:22:32.762511|assistant|I can't directly connect you with people since I don't have access to contact databases or the ability to facilitate real-time introductions. However, I can suggest some strategies for networking in your field:

**For AI research connections:**
- AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, FAccT for AI ethics)
- Stanford AI groups and seminars
- AI research Twitter/X communities
- Academic collaborations through paper co-authors

**For industry/venture connections:**
- AI meetups in the Bay Area
- Y Combinator events
- AI-focused VC firm events
- LinkedIn outreach to people working on similar LLM tooling
- AI ethics communities and workshops

**Specific communities you might find valuable:**
- Partnership on AI
- AI ethics research groups
- Environmental AI/climate tech networks
- Medical AI research communities

Would you like me to help you craft outreach messages or identify specific types of people you're looking to connect with? I could also suggest conversation starters based on your background.
